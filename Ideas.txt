Commands:

-create [bot_name]      (Creates 1 profile for the bot given)
-convert                (Converts profiles to any bot, given a .csv file)
-supported              (Lists all currently supported bots)
-combine [bot_name]     (User sends files [1 at a time] to combine into 1 file for the given bot_name)

What would be used more?

People creating a bot profile for ACO would only need 1 profile.. probably would use -create
ACO runners would probably use .csv for easy access

Therefore... for ACO providers, if users gave .csv files, they could easily message the bot the .csv file and convert everything into 1 bot or more -combine...


How would this help ACO forms?

It would take out user error from filling out forms
Users would not need to fill out a form, they could simply DM the bot and make the profile
ACO providers would not have to contact users as the bot would take away any error there is from filling out a form (and there is a lot)
ACO providers would need to download all of the files... and send in to the bot to -combine... (has to be a better way)

My thoughts on the last point would be to add even more functionality so ACO providers could do like !provide 5 "Yeezy Slots"

The bot would then take the first 5 reactions and DM them and convert all of the profiles given, and then send the file to the provider?
